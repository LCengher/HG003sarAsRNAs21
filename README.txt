This work was done by the Cheung Lab at Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Dartmouth and the Felden lab at Rennes 1 University, INSERM, BRM.

Each of the data sets was generated by one lab, and combined together to be able to find direct targets.The hypothesis being that CHIP data finds direct binding locations, and RNAseq finds regulatory (indirect and direct targets). Targets that have direct binding and regulations are directly regulated by SarA.

These files contain the input and output of two programs designed to use ChIP data to search a S. aureus genome for sRNAs (database at srd.genouest.org/) and then to look at the intersection for this data set with RNAseq expression data. Since sRNAs were not included in classical S. aureus genome annotations, are not well integrated into ChIP analysis software, and are relatively still unknown in terms of regulation, so special efforts were taken to look at this data for sRNAs.

The first program uses a concise apply loop to use ChIP peak data in order to search a gene list (sRNA in this case) which has start and end positions, as well as directionality. The second is a small program that is used to look at overlaps between ChIP and RNAseq outputs.

Here are their structures:

Finding_sRNA_nearPeaks.R
	Input
		"ChIP Pulldown Results (Threshold 0.1).csv"
		"sRNAs_NTCT8325.csv"
	Variables
		PosN <- as.numeric(100) #
	Output
		"sRNA Output Negative..."	#output list final
		"sRNA Output Positive..."	#output list final

Gene Overlap RNAseq ChIP.R
	Input
		"sarA_KO_HG003_RNASeq_2h.csv"		 #the two RNA-seq list were R bound together
		"sarA_KO_HG003_RNASeq_4h30min.csv"
		"ChIP Pulldown Results (Threshold 0.1).csv"

		"sRNA Output Positive 100bp (40).csv" # R bound together
		"sRNA Output Negative 100bp (42).csv"
	Output
***		"All sRNAs that are in RNAseq and have sarA under 100bp in 5' by ChIP.csv"		#looks at all sRNAs
*		"2h sRNAs that significant in RNAseq and have sarA under 100bp in 5' by ChIP.csv"	#looks at only the ones relevant in the 2h sRNAs
*		"4h sRNAs that significant in RNAseq and have sarA under 100bp in 5' by ChIP.csv"	#looks at only the ones relevant in the 4h sRNAs4


Summary
1) sRNA_nearPeaks
	Finds sRNAs that are near peaks
	This is already done by CLC workbench automatically for mRNAs
2) Gene Overlap RNAseq ChIP
	Only sRNAs
	Final output for sRNAs
